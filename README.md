## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a rather simple project, where I primarily practiced code that I was familiar with. One thing I put to use was using CSS grid to reorganize the flow of content between the mobile and the desktop view. 

I was proud of myself for needing to minimal help with writing the Javascript needed for the form validation. 


### Continued development

I look forward to working with more complex forms. Further challenging myself with styling and JS form validation.
